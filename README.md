# Research Mind Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for the **Research Mind** project, which is designed to analyze and process research papers, extract key information, and assist in indexing and managing academic content. The project is structured with several Python modules that handle different aspects of the workflow, from PDF processing to indexing content.

## Project Structure

- **`ai_interface.py`**: Contains the AI integration functions that facilitate interaction between the user and AI-driven modules. This script is responsible for processing user input and generating responses using AI models.

- **`indexing.py`**: Handles the indexing of research papers. It parses the content, extracts relevant sections, and organizes them for easy retrieval. This script is key for creating searchable indexes that can be used to quickly find information in large sets of research documents.

- **`main.py`**: The main entry point for the application. It coordinates the execution of different modules, handling the flow of data between them, and ensuring that the tasks are completed in sequence.

- **`pdf_processing.py`**: Contains functions to process PDF files, extract text, and preprocess it for further analysis. This module is crucial for converting research papers from their original format into text that can be indexed and analyzed.

## Installation

## Usage

1. **AI Interface**: 
   - Use the `ai_interface.py` to interact with the AI module for generating responses based on research data.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     python ai_interface.py
     ```

2. **Indexing Research Papers**:
   - Run `indexing.py` to create indexes from research documents.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     python indexing.py
     ```

3. **Processing PDFs**:
   - The `pdf_processing.py` script allows you to extract text from PDF files.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     python pdf_processing.py
     ```

4. **Main Script**:
   - Run `main.py` to execute the full workflow of the project.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
